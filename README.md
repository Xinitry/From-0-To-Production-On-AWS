## Cognito cURL Generator

This repository includes a Python script that generates cURL commands for AWS Cognito authentication. The script helps you obtain authentication tokens by creating the proper cURL request with the required SECRET_HASH.

### Usage

1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python3 cognito_curl_generator.py
   ```

2. **Provide credentials:**
   - The script will prompt for AWS region, email, password, client ID, and client secret
   - Alternatively, create a `credentials.json` file with your credentials:
   ```json
   {
     "region": "us-east-1",
     "email": "your-email@example.com",
     "password": "your-password",
     "client_id": "your-client-id",
     "client_secret": "your-client-secret"
   }
   ```

3. **Execute the generated cURL:**
   - The script saves the cURL command to `cognito_curl_command.txt`
   - Copy and run the command in your terminal to get your authentication token

### Output

The generated cURL command will authenticate with AWS Cognito and return a response containing:
- `AccessToken`
- `IdToken`
- `RefreshToken`

### Import to Postman

1. **Copy the cURL command:**
   - Open `cognito_curl_command.txt` and copy the entire cURL command

2. **Import in Postman:**
   - Open Postman
   - Click "Import" button (top left)
   - Paste the cURL command
   - Click "Continue" then "Import"

3. **Execute the request:**
   - The imported request will appear in your Postman collection
   - Click "Send" to execute and receive your authentication tokens
