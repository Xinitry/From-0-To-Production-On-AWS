# From 0 to Production on AWS

Welcome to the **From 0 to Production on AWS** repository — the companion repo for our YouTube series where we **solve frustrating AWS problems** that developers face in real-world projects.  

We don’t give step-by-step tutorials.  
We give you **real-world solutions to real-world problems**.  
Each branch in this repo corresponds to one video in the series, containing the exact code, configuration, or documentation shown in that episode.

## 📺 About the Series

Building on AWS can be powerful… and painfully confusing.  
Instead of “Hello World” demos, we jump straight into the **actual problems** you’ll hit on the road to production, like:

- Services not talking to each other  
- Cryptic error messages  
- Misleading defaults that break your app  
- “It works locally, but not in AWS” headaches  

Every video is focused on one issue — what’s wrong, **why** it happens, and how to fix it.
