# From 0 to Production on AWS

Welcome to the **From 0 to Production on AWS** repository ‚Äî the companion repo for our YouTube series where we **solve frustrating AWS problems** that developers face in real-world projects.  

We don‚Äôt give step-by-step tutorials.  
We give you **real-world solutions to real-world problems**.  
Each branch in this repo corresponds to one video in the series, containing the exact code, configuration, or documentation shown in that episode.

## üì∫ About the Series

Building on AWS can be powerful‚Ä¶ and painfully confusing.  
Instead of ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù demos, we jump straight into the **actual problems** you‚Äôll hit on the road to production, like:

- Services not talking to each other  
- Cryptic error messages  
- Misleading defaults that break your app  
- ‚ÄúIt works locally, but not in AWS‚Äù headaches  

Every video is focused on one issue ‚Äî what‚Äôs wrong, **why** it happens, and how to fix it.
